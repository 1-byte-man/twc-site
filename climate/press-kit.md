Below are some resources to help convince your co-workers and management why they should support the upcoming Climate Strike.

## Outreach

A sample message you can post in your company slack or group email along with an image, for example:
```
This was the hottest summer ever recorded, thanks to climate change.

Several tech companies like Atlassian, Amazon, Google and Microsoft wrote why they are joining the climate march. Perhaps ours should as well.

I am wondering if we could participate for half a day on Friday September 20th to show our commitment to a greener future.

I know environment/climate change is a big topic, so I want to focus the discussion on whether it's possible to participate in the climate march this upcoming September 20th.
